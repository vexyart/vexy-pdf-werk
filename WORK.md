## Enterprise Feature Removal Complete ✅

Successfully removed all enterprise bloat and unnecessary features from the codebase.

### Completed Simplification Tasks

1. ✅ **Validation Simplification**
   - Removed enterprise disk space validation and health checks
   - Removed paranoid permission checking and resource monitoring
   - Simplified to basic file existence and format validation only
   - Removed excessive error messaging and user guidance bloat

2. ✅ **Logging De-bloating**
   - Removed all performance monitoring and metrics collection
   - Removed structured logging with enterprise "process stages"
   - Removed timing metrics and detailed operational logging
   - Eliminated enterprise-grade error tracking and reporting

3. ✅ **Configuration Simplification**
   - Removed complex validation systems
   - Eliminated resource usage monitoring configuration
   - Simplified to basic format and path validation only

4. ✅ **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Updated PLAN.md to remove enterprise features and monitoring
   - Updated TODO.md to focus on simplicity over enterprise robustness
   - Removed references to resource management and health monitoring

## Architecture Improvements

- **Simplicity**: Removed unnecessary enterprise patterns and monitoring
- **Basic Validation**: Simple file checks without paranoid safety features
- **Clean Fallbacks**: Converters fall back gracefully without excessive logging
- **Streamlined Code**: Removed enterprise bloat while maintaining core functionality

## Quality Focus

- **Essential Features Only**: Core PDF conversion without enterprise overhead
- **Simple Error Handling**: Basic try/catch without complex error categorization
- **Minimal Validation**: Just enough to prevent obvious failures
- **Clean Code**: Removed enterprise patterns that don't add user value

## Current State

The codebase is now simplified and focused on core functionality:

- **Clean Conversion**: PDF-to-Markdown backends without monitoring overhead
- **Simple Selection**: Auto-detection without performance tracking
- **Basic Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation without extensive logging
- **User-Focused**: Features that users actually need, not enterprise bloat
