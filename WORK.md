## Current Iteration: Critical Package Infrastructure Fixes

### Active Tasks

1. **Fix critical package structure issues**
   - Status: Starting
   - Priority: Critical
   - Details: Package cannot be imported due to missing __init__.py and version conflicts

2. **Complete essential project documentation**
   - Status: In Progress
   - Priority: High
   - Details: README needs proper content, py.typed marker missing

3. **Validate development toolchain**
   - Status: Pending
   - Priority: High
   - Details: Need to ensure all tools work after package fixes

### Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Create proper src/vexy_pdf_werk/__init__.py file
- [ ] Check current package import behavior
- [ ] Fix version handling to use hatch-vcs properly
- [ ] Update README.md with actual project information
- [ ] Add py.typed marker for type hint support
- [ ] Test complete development workflow

### Issues to Address

1. **Import Failures**: Package structure prevents successful imports
2. **Version Conflicts**: Hardcoded version conflicts with hatch-vcs
3. **Test Failures**: Tests cannot run due to import issues
4. **Missing Documentation**: README has placeholder content

### Work Log

**2024-01-XX**: Created comprehensive 4-part development specification
- Completed detailed technical architecture documentation
- Established clear implementation roadmap
- Created testing and deployment procedures

**Next**: Beginning critical infrastructure fixes to make package functional
