## Current Iteration Focus

Working on Phase 1: Finalize and Test AI Structure Enhancement (QDF Pipeline)

### Immediate Tasks for This Session

1. **Write unit tests for the QDFProcessor** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Mock qpdf subprocess calls
   - Test PDF to QDF/JSON conversion
   - Test text extraction from QDF

2. **Write unit tests for diff application logic**
   - Test apply_diff_to_qdf function
   - Various diff formats and edge cases

3. **Create integration tests for end-to-end workflow**
   - Mock AI service responses
   - Test complete _enhance_with_ai_structure pipeline

## Completed Work

1. ✅ **QDF Processor Unit Tests** - Comprehensive tests for QDF/JSON processing with 92% coverage
2. ✅ **Diff Application Logic** - Implemented unified diff parsing and application with full test coverage
3. ✅ **Integration Tests** - Complete end-to-end testing for AI structure enhancement workflow (6 test scenarios)
4. ✅ **AI Prompt Refinement** - Updated prompts for both Claude and Gemini with best practices for OCR correction and structure enhancement
5. ✅ **Robust Error Handling** - Implemented comprehensive error handling in _enhance_with_ai_structure with timeouts, retries, validation, and graceful fallbacks

## Current Work

- **Fixing Metadata Extractor Tests** (16 failing tests)
  - API mismatches: `word_count` vs `estimated_word_count`
  - Constructor signature changes
  - Missing attributes and mocking issues
  - Need to align tests with current implementation
