# Project Quality & Reliability Improvement Plan

## Project Overview

This plan addresses critical structural and documentation issues in the vexy-pdf-werk Python package to establish a solid foundation for development. The focus is on fixing fundamental problems that prevent proper package functionality and establishing essential project management practices.

Also see full `SPEC.md` 

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Package Structure
- Follow src-layout pattern (already established)
- Use hatch-vcs for version management from git tags
- Implement proper Python package initialization
- Support type hints with py.typed marker

### Development Workflow
- Maintain hatch-based environment management
- Use uv for fast dependency resolution
- Continue with ruff/mypy/pytest toolchain
- Follow PEP 621 packaging standards

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Package Structure Issues

**Objective:** Resolve fundamental import and version management problems

**Tasks:**
1. **Create proper __init__.py file**
   - Problem: Package cannot be imported due to missing __init__.py
   - Solution: Create src/vexy_pdf_werk/__init__.py with proper exports
   - Import main classes/functions from main module
   - Expose __version__ at package level
   
2. **Integrate hatch-vcs versioning**
   - Problem: Version is hardcoded in main module, conflicts with hatch-vcs
   - Solution: Remove hardcoded version, let hatch-vcs manage it
   - Update imports to use generated _version.py
   - Ensure version is accessible at package level

3. **Fix test imports**
   - Problem: test_package.py tries to import package that can't be imported
   - Solution: Ensure package structure allows successful imports
   - Add basic smoke tests for main functionality
   - Verify test suite runs without errors

**Testing Strategy:**
- Run `hatch run test` to verify tests pass
- Test package import: `python -c "import vexy_pdf_werk; print(vexy_pdf_werk.__version__)"`
- Verify hatch-vcs version generation works

### Phase 2: Complete Essential Documentation

**Objective:** Provide proper project documentation and change tracking

**Tasks:**
1. **Fix README.md**
   - Problem: README has empty title and generic content
   - Solution: Add proper project title, description, and purpose
   - Include accurate installation and usage examples
   - Document development workflow with correct commands

2. **Create CHANGELOG.md**
   - Problem: No change tracking for releases
   - Solution: Create CHANGELOG following Keep a Changelog format
   - Document initial release and recent improvements
   - Prepare for future version tracking

3. **Add type hint support**
   - Problem: Package doesn't declare type hint support
   - Solution: Create src/vexy_pdf_werk/py.typed marker file
   - Ensure type checkers recognize the package supports types
   - Validate mypy can analyze package types

**Validation Criteria:**
- README clearly explains what the package does
- CHANGELOG follows standard format
- Type checkers recognize package type hints

### Phase 3: Establish Project Management Foundation

**Objective:** Create project management structure following CLAUDE.md guidelines

**Tasks:**
1. **Create comprehensive PLAN.md**
   - Document long-term project goals and architecture
   - Define development phases and milestones
   - Include technical specifications and patterns

2. **Initialize WORK.md**
   - Track current development activities
   - Document work-in-progress items
   - Provide status updates for ongoing tasks

3. **Validate development toolchain**
   - Problem: Tools may not work correctly with fixed package structure
   - Solution: Run full development workflow validation
   - Test hatch environments and scripts
   - Verify ruff, mypy, pytest integration
   - Ensure pre-commit hooks work

**Success Metrics:**
- All hatch commands execute successfully
- Development workflow is fully functional
- Project follows established conventions

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Version Management
- Handle case where git tags don't exist yet
- Ensure version fallback works in development
- Test version access from different import paths

### Package Import Issues
- Verify package imports work from different contexts
- Handle circular import scenarios
- Test compatibility with different Python versions

### Tool Integration
- Ensure tools work with src-layout structure
- Validate tool configuration after package fixes
- Test development workflow end-to-end

## Testing & Validation Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Verify package can be imported successfully
- Test version access and format
- Validate main module functionality

### Integration Testing  
- Run complete development workflow
- Test hatch environment creation and scripts
- Verify tool integration (ruff, mypy, pytest)

### Documentation Testing
- Validate README examples work
- Test installation instructions
- Verify development setup steps

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Import failures:** Package structure changes could break existing code
  - Mitigation: Careful testing of import paths
- **Version conflicts:** hatch-vcs integration might conflict with existing version handling
  - Mitigation: Remove hardcoded versions systematically

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Tool configuration issues:** Development tools might need reconfiguration
  - Mitigation: Test full workflow after changes
- **Documentation accuracy:** Examples might not match actual behavior
  - Mitigation: Test all documented examples

## Future Considerations

### Immediate Next Steps (Post-Plan)
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Validate each change incrementally  
- Test package functionality continuously

### Longer-term Improvements
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Implement actual PDF processing functionality
- Add CLI interface if needed
- Enhance documentation with examples

This plan focuses exclusively on foundational reliability and does not include new feature development, maintaining the scope as requested.
