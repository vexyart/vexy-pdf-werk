# Vexy PDF Werk (VPW) - Part 1: Planning and Architecture

**Problem Analysis**: What exactly are we solving and why?

We're creating a comprehensive PDF processing tool that transforms "vexing" PDFs into multiple high-quality, accessible formats. The core problems we're solving:

1. **PDF/A Compliance**: Many PDFs aren't archival-quality or standardized
2. **OCR Quality**: Scanned documents often have poor or missing text layers
3. **Format Conversion**: Need to convert PDFs to modern formats (Markdown, ePub)
4. **Metadata Management**: Extract and standardize bibliographic information
5. **AI Enhancement**: Use LLMs to improve OCR accuracy and content extraction

**Constraints**: What limitations must we respect?

- Must use modern Python toolchain (hatch, ruff, uv, git-tag-based semver)
- Must integrate with existing robust tools (qpdf, OCRmyPDF) rather than reinventing
- Must support optional advanced features (Marker, AI services) without breaking core functionality
- Must follow anti-enterprise bloat guidelines - keep it simple
- Must work cross-platform with appropriate configuration directories

**Solution Options**: What are 2-3 viable approaches with trade-offs?

1. **Modular Pipeline Approach** (CHOSEN)
   - Sequential processing stages: PDF enhancement → Markdown conversion → ePub creation → Metadata extraction
   - Clean separation of concerns, easy testing, optional stages
   - Trade-off: More complex than monolithic, but much more maintainable

2. **Monolithic Processing**
   - Single large function handling everything
   - Simple but inflexible, hard to test, no optional features

3. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Extensible converter system
   - Over-engineered for this use case, violates simplicity principles

### 1.1. Project Scope (One Sentence)

**VPW transforms PDF documents into PDF/A format, paginated Markdown, ePub, and bibliographic YAML through a configurable pipeline using proven external tools.**

### 1.2. High-Level Architecture

#### 1.2.1. Data Flow Pipeline

```
Input PDF → PDF Analysis → OCR Enhancement → PDF/A Creation → Content Extraction → Format Generation → Output Files
                           ↓
                    Optional AI Enhancement
```

#### 1.2.2. Core Components

1. **PDF Processor** - Handles OCR, PDF/A conversion, quality enhancement
2. **Content Extractors** - Multiple backends for PDF-to-Markdown conversion
3. **Format Generators** - Creates ePub and metadata outputs
4. **AI Integrations** - Optional LLM services for enhancement
5. **CLI Interface** - Fire-based command-line tool
6. **Configuration System** - TOML-based settings management
