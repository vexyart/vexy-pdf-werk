# Output Formats

Vexy PDF Werk can generate a variety of output formats from a single PDF file.

## PDF/A

A PDF/A file is an archivable version of your PDF. It includes a searchable text layer (thanks to OCR) and is standardized for long-term preservation.

## Markdown

VPW can convert your PDF into a series of Markdown files, one for each page. This is useful for extracting the text content of your PDF and for further processing.

## ePub

An ePub file is an e-book format that can be read on a variety of devices. VPW generates an ePub file from the Markdown content.

## YAML

A YAML file containing bibliographic and processing metadata is also generated. This includes information like the number of pages, the author and title of the document, and the processing time.
