Paralinx about camera integration; Amazon,
Google and IBM about cloud computing.
WWDC and Silicon Valley: We were very
pleasantly surprised to be invited by Apple to
their World Wide Developers Conference in
San Jose in June, despite not having applied.
It's a valuable chance to learn and make new
connections. Weâ€™re also setting aside time to
meet other potential partners.
Cine Gear: We have decided not to attend
the Cine Gear expo in L.A. this year, since
feedback from many users about the show
were mixed, and our planned beta version of
3.0 is slightly delayed.
Development and launch: Development
is around one month behind our original
schedule. We expect the delay to decrease,
with new developers on board.
The launch of Drylab 3.0 will take place at
the International Broadcasters Convention
in Amsterdam in September, and we are
working hard to get solid feedback from pilot
users before then.
Annual General Meeting: Drylab's AGM
will be held on June 16th at 15:00. An
invitation will be distributed to all owners
well in advance. We hope to see you there!
As you can see it has been a hectic
spring that has given us a lot of
confirmation about our product. We
are now working eagerly and hard
towards the US launch with Drylab 3.0,
while keeping momentum in Europe
with our existing system.
