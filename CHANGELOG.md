### Fixed - Examples Package Missing PDF Enhancement
- **Example Code Analysis**: Identified and documented missing PDF enhancement functionality in examples
  - All 7 example scripts (4 Python + 3 Shell) only generate Markdown, ePub, and metadata files
  - None of the examples call `PDFProcessor.create_better_pdf()` method for PDF/A enhancement
  - Missing integration of OCR processing (OCRmyPDF) and AI enhancement features
  - Examples output directories contain no enhanced PDF files despite having the capability
- **Root Cause Documentation**: PDFProcessor has complete enhancement pipeline but examples skip this step
  - `create_better_pdf()` method includes OCR enhancement, AI processing, and PDF/A conversion
  - Examples only demonstrate: analyze_pdf() → generate_markdown() → create_epub() → extract_metadata()
